# TargetDistribution
Python program to find all combinations of items resulting in a given target as the sum.

Clone the project from https://github.com/saitj99/TargetDistribution.

The project should contain one python file (itemDistribution.py) which consists of the code for the puzzle. 

The program is written in Python 3.6 and once the program is run asks the user to enter the input file name. A sample input file called data.csv is provided. The input file can be edited or new input files can be specified for the program.

I solved the puzzle by performing an exhaustive search to find all combinations of items which result in the specified Target price.
